Our preferences across music, food, books and entertainment have a huge impact on the kind of people we hang out with. It is through this network of people with similar interests we often stumble upon other interesting content. A lot of platforms like Spotify and YouTube use this fact to power recommendations through collaborative filtering. Our idea is to build an engine that uses user centric data collected from multiple platforms like Spotify, Reddit, and Youtube for making cross-platform recommendations and finding other users with similar taste profiles.
